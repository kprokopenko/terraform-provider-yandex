## Import

The resource can be imported by using their `resource ID`. For getting the resource ID you can use Yandex Cloud [Web Console](https://console.yandex.cloud) or [YC CLI](https://yandex.cloud/docs/cli/quickstart).

```bash
# terraform import yandex_dataproc_cluster.<resource Name> <resource Id> 
terraform import yandex_dataproc_cluster.foo c9q85**********gpn21
```
